Bernard Lang defines parsing as the calculation of the
  intersection of a FSA (the input) and a CFG.  Viewing the input for
  parsing as a FSA rather than as a string combines well with some
  approaches in speech understanding systems, in which parsing takes
  a word lattice as input (rather than a word string).  Furthermore, certain
  techniques for robust parsing can be modelled as finite state
  transducers.
In this paper we investigate how we can generalize this approach
  for unification grammars. In particular we will concentrate on how we
  might the calculation of the intersection of a FSA and a DCG. It is shown
  that existing parsing algorithms can be easily extended for FSA
  inputs. However, we also show that the termination properties change
  drastically: we show that it is undecidable whether the intersection
  of a FSA and a DCG is empty (even if the DCG is off-line parsable).
Furthermore we discuss approaches to cope with the problem.
