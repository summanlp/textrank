Recently, several types of Japanese-to-English machine translation
  systems have been developed, but all of them require an initial
  process of rewriting the original text into easily translatable
  Japanese.  Therefore these systems are unsuitable for translating
  information that needs to be speedily disseminated.  To overcome
  this limitation, a Multi-Level Translation Method based on the
  Constructive Process Theory has been proposed.  This paper describes
  the benefits of using this method in the Japanese-to-English machine
  translation system ALT-J/E.
In comparison with conventional compositional methods, the
  Multi-Level Translation Method emphasizes the importance of the
  meaning contained in expression structures as a whole.  It is shown
  to be capable of translating typical written Japanese based on the
  meaning of the text in its context, with  comparative ease.
  We are now hopeful of carrying out useful machine translation with
  no manual pre-editing.
