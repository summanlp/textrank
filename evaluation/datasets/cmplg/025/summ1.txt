Recent work has considered corpus-based or statistical approaches to
the problem of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity.
Typically, ambiguous verb phrases of the form v np1 p np2 are
resolved through a model which considers values of the four head
words (v, n1, p and n2). This paper shows that the
problem is analogous to n-gram language models in speech
recognition, and that one of the most common methods for language modeling,
the backed-off estimate, is applicable. Results on Wall
Street Journal data of 84.5% accuracy are obtained using this method.
A surprising result is the importance of
low-count events - ignoring events which occur less than 5
times in training data reduces performance to 81.6%.
