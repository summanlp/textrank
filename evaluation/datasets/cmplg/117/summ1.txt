The temporal relations that hold between events described by
successive utterances are often left implicit or underspecified.  We
address the role of two phenomena with respect to the recovery of
these relations: (1) the referential properties of tense, and (2) the
role of temporal constraints imposed by coherence relations.  We
account for several facets of the identification of temporal
relations through an integration of these.
