This paper presents a new measure of semantic similarity in an  IS-A
taxonomy, based on the notion of information content.  Experimental evaluation
suggests that the measure performs encouragingly well (a correlation of r =
0.79 with a benchmark set of human similarity judgments, with an upper bound
of r = 0.90 for human subjects performing the same task), and significantly
better than the traditional edge counting approach (r = 0.66).
