In a consistent text,
many words and phrases are repeatedly used in more than one sentence.
When an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words)
is repeated in different sentences, the constituent words of those
sentences tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with
identical parts of speech and identical modifiee-modifier relationships.
Thus, when a syntactic parser cannot parse a sentence as a unified
structure, parts of speech and modifiee-modifier relationships among
morphologically identical words in complete parses of other sentences
within the same text provide useful information for obtaining partial
parses of the sentence.
In this paper, we describe a method for completing partial parses
by maintaining consistency among morphologically identical words within
the same text as regards their part of speech and their
modifiee-modifier relationship.
The experimental results obtained by using this method with technical
documents offer good prospects for improving the accuracy of sentence
analysis in a broad-coverage natural language processing system such as
a machine translation system.
