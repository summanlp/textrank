<TITLE>AN EXPERIMENT ON LEARNING APPROPRIATE SELECTIONAL
RESTRICTIONS FROM A PARSED CORPUS1 </TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
<P>
We present a methodology to extract Selectional Restrictions at a
variable level of abstraction from phrasally analyzed corpora. The
method relays in the use of a wide-coverage noun taxonomy and a
statistical measure of the co-occurrence of linguistic items. Some
experimental results about the performance of the method are
provided.

<DIV ID="1" DEPTH="1" R-NO="1"><HEADER>    INTRODUCTION
</HEADER>
<P>
These last years there has been a common agreement in the natural
language processing research community on the importance of having an
extensive coverage of the surface lexical semantics of the domain to
work with, (specially, typical contexts of use). This knowledge may be
expressed at different levels of abstraction depending on the
phenomena involved: selectional restrictions (SRs), lexical
preferences, col-locations, etc. We are specially interested on SRs,
which can be expressed as semantic type constraints that a word sense
imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic
interpretation. SRs must include information on the syntactic position
of the words that are being restricted semantically.  For instance,
one of the senses of the verb drink restricts its subject
to be an animal and its object to be a liquid.
</P>
<P>
SRs may help a parser to prefer some parses among several grammatical
ones
 <REF/>.  Furthermore, SRs may help the parser when deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement. Lexicography is also
interested in the acquisition of SRs. On the one hand, SRs are an
interesting information to be included in dictionaries (defining
 in context approach). On the other hand, as <REF/> remark, the effort involved in analyzing and classifying all the linguistic
material provided by concordances of use of a word can be extremely
labor-intensive. If it was possible to represent roughly the SRs of
the word being studied, it could be possible to classify roughly the
concordances automatically in the different word uses before the
lexicographer analysis.
</P>
<P>
The possible sources of SRs are: introspection by lexicographers,
machine-readable dictionaries, and on-line corpora.  The main
advantage of the latter is that they provide experimental evidence of
words uses. Recently, several approaches on acquiring different kinds
of lexical information from corpora have been developed
 ,<REF/>. This paper is interested in exploring the amenability of using a method for
extracting SRs from textual data, in the line of these works.  The aim
of the proposed technique is to learn the SRs that a word is imposing,
from the analysis of the examples of use of that word contained in the
corpus. An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure
 <CREF/>, where the system, departing from the three examples of use, and knowing that prosecutor, buyer and
lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class

<DIV ID="2" DEPTH="1" R-NO="2"><HEADER>    THE METHOD OF ACQUISITION
</HEADER>
<P>
SRs have been used to express semantic constraints holding in
different syntactic and functional configurations. However, in this
paper we focus only in selectional restrictions holding between verbs
and their complements. The method can be easily exported to other
configurations. We won't distinguish the SRs imposed by verbs on
arguments and adjuncts. We believe that few adjuncts are going to
provide enough evidence in the corpus for creating SRs. In the
following paragraphs we describe the functional specification of the
system.
</P>
<P>
Training set
</P>
<P>
The input to the learning process is a list of co-occurrence
triples codifying the co-occurrence of verbs and complement heads in
the corpus: (verb, syntactic relationship, noun).  Verb
and noun are the lemmas of the inflected forms appearing in
text. Syntactic relationship codes the kind of complement: 0 subject, 1 object , or preposition in case it is a
PP. A method to draw the co-occurrence triples from corpus is proposed
 in subsection <CREF/>. 
</P>
<P>
Output
</P>
<P>
The result of the learning process is a set of syntactic SRs, (verb, syntactic relationship, semantic class).  Semantic classes are
represented extensionally as sets of nouns.  SRs are only acquired if
there are enough cases in the corpus as to gather statistical
evidence.  As long as distinct uses of the same verb can have
different SRs, we permit to extract more than one class for the same
syntactic position. Nevertheless, they must be mutually disjoint,
i.e. not related by hyperonymy.
</P>
<P>
Previous knowledge used
</P>
<P>
In the process of learning SRs, the system needs to know how words are
clustered in semantic classes, and how semantic classes are
hierarchically organized. Ambiguous words must be represented as
having different hyperonym classes.  In subsection
 <CREF/> we defend the use of a broad-coverage taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
Learning process
</P>
<P>
The computational process is divided in three stages: (1) Guessing the
possible semantic classes, i.e.  creation of the space of candidates.
In principle, all the hyperonyms (at all levels) of the nouns
appearing in the training set are candidates.  (2) Evaluation of the
appropriateness of the candidates. In order to compare the different
candidates, an statistical measure summarizing the relevance of the
occurrence of each of the candidate classes is used.  (3) Selection of
the most appropriate subset of the candidate space to convey the SRs,
taking into account that the final classes must be mutually disjoint.
 While in subsection <CREF/> an statistical measure to fulfill stage 2 is presented, stages 1 and 3 are discussed in
 <CREF/> thoroughly. 
</P>
<DIV ID="2.1" DEPTH="2" R-NO="1"><HEADER>    Extracting Co-occurrence Triples
</HEADER>
<P>
In any process of learning from examples the accuracy of the training
set is the base for the system to make correct predictions. In our
case, where the semantic classes are hypothesized not univoquely from
the examples, accuracy becomes fundamental.
</P>
<P>
Different approaches to obtain lexical co-occurrences have
 been proposed in the literature <REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>. These approaches seem inappropriate for tackling our needs, either
because they detect only local
 co-occurrences<REF/>,<REF/>, or because they extract many  spurious co-occurrence triples <REF/>,<REF/>.  On the one hand, our system intends to learn SRs on any kind of verb's
complements. On the other hand, the fact that these approaches extract
co-occurrences without reliability on being verb-complements violates
accuracy requirements.
</P>
<P>
However, if the co-occurrences were extracted from a corpus annotated
with structural syntactic information (i.e., part of speech and
``skeletal'' trees), the results would have considerably higher
degrees of accuracy and representativity. In this way, it would be
easy to detect all the relationships between verb and complements, and
few non-related co-occurrences would be extracted. The most serious
objection to this approach is that the task of producing syntactic
analyzed corpora is very expensive.  Nevertheless, lately there has
been a growing interest to produce skeletally analyzed
 corpora 
</P>
<P>
A parser, with some simple heuristics, would be enough to meet the
requirements of representativeness and accuracy introduced above. On
the other hand, it could be useful to represent the co-occurrence
triples as holding between lemmas, in order to gather as much evidence
as possible. A simple morphological analyzer that could get the lemma
for a big percentage of the words appearing in the corpus would
suffice.
</P>

<DIV ID="2.2" DEPTH="2" R-NO="2"><HEADER>    Semantic Knowledge Used
</HEADER>
<P>
Of the two class-based approaches presented in section
 <CREF/>, <REF/>'s technique uses a wide-coverage semantic taxonomy , whereas
 <REF/> consists in hand-tagging with a fixed set of semantic labels . The advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are
 diverse. On the one hand, in <REF/> approach, semantic classes relevant to the domain are chosen, and consequently, the
adjustment of the classes to the corpus is quite nice. Nevertheless,
 <REF/>'s system is less constrained and is able to induce a most appropriate level for
 the SRs. On the other hand, while <REF/> implies hand-coding all the relevant words with semantic tags,
 <REF/> needs a broad semantic taxonomy. However, there is  already an available taxonomy, WordNet. We take <REF/> approach because of the better results obtained, and the lower cost involved.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="2.3" DEPTH="2" R-NO="3"><HEADER>    Class appropriateness: the Association Score
</HEADER>
<P>
When trying to choose a measure of the appropriateness of a semantic
class, we have to consider the features of the problem: (1) robustness
in front of noise, and (2) conservatism in order to be able to
generalize only from positive examples, without having the tendency to
over-generalize.
</P>
<P>
Several statistical measures that accomplish these requirements have
 been proposed in the literature <REF/>,<REF/>,<REF/>.  We adopt <REF/>'s approach, which quantifies the statistical association between verbs and classes of nouns from their
co-occurrence. However we adapt it taking into account the syntactic
position of the relationship. Let
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
be the sets of all verbs, nouns, syntactic positions, and possible
noun classes, respectively.  Given 
<!-- MATH: $v \in {\cal V}$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
and 
<!-- MATH: $c \in {\cal C}$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 ,
Association
Score, Assoc, between v and c in a syntactic position s is
defined to be
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
Where conditional probabilities are estimated by counting the number
of observations of the joint event and dividing by the frequency of
the given event, e.g.
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
The two terms of Assoc try to capture different properties of the SR
expressed by the candidate class. Mutual information, I(v;c|s),
measures the strength of the statistical association between the given
verb v and the candidate class c in the given syntactic position
s.  If there is a real relationship, then hopefully 
<!-- MATH: $I(v,c|s)
\gg 0$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
.
On the other hand, the conditional probability, P(c|v,s),
favors those classes that have more occurrences of nouns.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="2.4" DEPTH="2" R-NO="4"><HEADER>    Selecting the best classes
</HEADER>
<P>
The existence of noise in the training set introduces classes in the
candidate space that can't be considered as expressing SRs.  A common
technique used for ignoring as far as possible this noise is to
consider only those events that have a higher number of occurrences
than a certain threshold. However, some erroneous classes may
persist because they exceed the threshold. However, if candidate
classes were ordered by the significance of their Assoc with the verb,
it is likely that less appropriate classes (introduced by noise) would
be ranked in the last positions of the candidate list.
</P>
<P>
The algorithm to learn SRs is based in a search through all the
classes with more instances in the training set than the given
threshold. In different iterations over these candidate classes, two
operations are performed: first, the class, c, having the best
Assoc (best class), is extracted for the final result; and second,
the remaining candidate classes are filtered from classes being
hyper/hyponyms to the best class.  This last step is made because the
definitive classes must be mutually disjoint. The iterations are
repeated until the candidate space has been run out.
</P>
<P>
 <REF/> performed a similar learning process, but while he was only looking for the preferred class of object nouns, we are interested in
all the possible classes (SRs). He performed a best-first search on
the candidate space. However, if the function to maximize doesn't have
a monotone behavior (as it is the case of Assoc) the best-first search
doesn't guarantee global optimals, but only local ones.  This fact
made us to decide for a global search, specially because the candidate
space is not so big.
</P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="3" DEPTH="1" R-NO="3"><HEADER>    EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
</HEADER>
<P>
In order to experiment the methodology presented, we implemented a
system in a Unix machine.  The corpus used for extracting
co-occurrence triples is a fragment of parsed material from the Penn
Treebank Corpus (about 880,000 words and 35,000 sentences), consisting
of articles of the Wall Street Journal, that has been tagged and
parsed.  We used Wordnet as the verb and noun lexicons for the
lemmatizer, and also as the semantic taxonomy for clustering nouns in
semantic classes. In this section we evaluate the performance of the
methodology implemented: (1) looking at the performance of the
techniques used for extracting triples, (2) considering the coverage
of the WordNet taxonomy regarding the noun senses appearing in
Treebank, and (3) analyzing the performance of the learning process.
</P>
<P>
The total number of co-occurrence triples extracted amounts to
190,766. Many of these triples (68,800, 36.1%) were discarded before
the lemmatizing process because the surface NP head wasn't a noun. The
remaining 121,966 triples were processed through the lemmatizer.
113,583 (93.1%) could be correctly mapped into their corresponding
lemma form.
</P>
<P>
In addition, we analyzed manually the results obtained for a subset of
the extracted triples, looking at the sentences in the corpus where
they occurred. The subset contains 2,658 examples of four average
common verbs in the Treebank: rise, report, seek and
present (from now on, the testing sample).  On the one
hand, 235 (8.8%) of these triples were considered to be extracted
erroneously because of the parser, and 51 (1.9%) because of the
lemmatizer. Summarizing, 2,372 (89.2%) of the triples in the testing
set were considered to be correctly extracted and lemmatized.
</P>
<P>
 When analyzing the coverage of WordNet taxonomy we considered two different ratios. On the one hand, how many of the noun occurrences have one or more senses
included in the taxonomy: 113,583 of the 117,215 extracted triples
(96.9%). On the other hand, how many of the noun occurrences in the
testing sample have the correct sense introduced in the taxonomy:
2,165 of the 2,372 well-extracted triples (92.3%). These figures give
a positive evaluation of the coverage of WordNet.
</P>
<P>
In order to evaluate the performance of the learning process we
inspected manually the SRs acquired on the testing-sample, assessing
if they corresponded to the actual SRs imposed.  A first way of
evaluation is by means of measuring precision and recall
ratios in the testing sample. In our case, we define precision as the
proportion of triples appearing in syntactic positions with acquired
SRs, which effectively fulfill one of those SRs. Precision amounts to
79.2%. The remaining 20.8% triples didn't belong to any of the
classes induced for their syntactic positions. Some of them because
they didn't have the correct sense included in the WordNet taxonomy,
and others because the correct class had not been induced because
there wasn't enough evidence.  On the other hand, we define recall as
the proportion of triples which fulfill one of the SRs acquired for
their corresponding syntactic positions. Recall amounts to 75.7%.
</P>
<P>
A second way of evaluating the performance of the abstraction process
is to manually diagnose the reasons that have made the system to
 deduce the SRs obtained.  Table <CREF/> shows the SRs corresponding to the subject position of the verb seek. Type indicates the diagnostic about the class
appropriateness. Assoc, the value of the association score. ``#
n'', the number of nouns appearing in the corpus that are contained
in the class. Finally, ``# s'' indicates the number of actual noun
senses used in the corpus which are contained in the class. In this
table we can see some examples of the five types of manual diagnostic:
</P>
<P>
Ok
The acquired SR is correct according to the noun senses
contained in the corpus.
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 Abs
The best level for stating the SR is not the one induced, but a lower
one.  It happens because erroneous senses, metonymies, ..., accumulate
evidence for the higher class.
</P>
<P>
<!-- MATH: $\Downarrow$ -->
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
 Abs
Some of the SRs could be best gathered in a
unique class. We didn't find any such case. 
</P>
<P>
Senses
The class has cropped up because it accumulates enough
evidence, provided by erroneous senses.
</P>
<P>
Noise
The class accumulates enough evidence provided by
erroneously extracted triples.
</P>
<P>
 Table <CREF/> shows the incidence of the diagnostic types in the testing sample.  Each row shows: the type of diagnostic, the
number and percentage of classes that accomplish it, and the number
and percentage of noun occurrences contained by these classes in the
testing sample
  and     <CREF/>) we draw some positive (a, e) and some negative conclusions (b, c, d and f):
a.
Almost one correct semantic class for each syntactic position
in
the sample is acquired. The technique achieves a good coverage, even
with few co-occurrence triples.
</P>
<P>
b.
Although many of the classes acquired result
from the accumulation of incorrect senses (73.3%), it seems that
their size tends to be smaller than classes in other categories, as
they only contain a 51.4% of the senses .
</P>
<P>
c.
There doesn't seem to be a clear
co-relation between Assoc and the manual diagnostic. Specifically, the
classes considered to be correct sometimes aren't ranked in the higher
 positions of the Assoc (e.g., Table <CREF/>). 
</P>
<P>
d.
The over-generalization seems to be produced because
of little difference in the nouns included in the rival classes.
Nevertheless this situation is rare.
</P>
<P>
e.
The impact of noise provided by  erroneous extraction of
co-occurrence triples, in the acquisition of wrong semantic classes,
seems to be very moderate.
</P>
<P>
f.
Since different verb senses occur in the corpus,
the SRs acquired appear mixed.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="4" DEPTH="1" R-NO="4"><HEADER>    FURTHER WORK
</HEADER>
<P>
Although performance of the technique presented is pretty good, some
of the detected problems could possibly be solved. Specifically, there
are various ways to explore in order to reduce the problems stated in
points b and c above:
</P>
<P>
1.
To measure the Assoc by means of Mutual Information between the
pair v-s and c. In this way, the syntactic position also
would provide information (statistical evidence) for measuring the
most appropriate classes.
</P>
<P>
2.
To modify the Assoc in such a way that it was based in a
 likelihood ratio test <REF/>. It seems that this kind of tests have a better performance than mutual information when the
counts are small, as it is the case.
</P>
<P>
3.
To estimate the probabilities of classes, not directly from the
frequencies of their noun members, but correcting this evidence by the
number of senses of those nouns, e.g
</P>
<IMAGE TYPE="FIGURE"/>
<P>
In this way, the estimated function would be a probability
distribution, and more interesting, nouns would provide evidence on
the occurrence of their hyperonyms, inversely proportional to their
degree of ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
4.
To collect a bigger number of examples for each verbal
complement, projecting the complements in the internal arguments,
using diathesis sub-categorization rules. Hopefully, Assoc would have
a better performance if it was estimated on a bigger population. On
the other hand, in this way it would be possible to detect the SRs
holding on internal arguments.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve point d above, we have foreseen two
possibilities:
</P>
<P>
1.
To take into
consideration the statistical significance of the alternatives
involved, before doing a generalization step, climbing upwards,
</P>
<P>
2.
To use the PPs that in the
corpus are attached to other complements and not to the main verb as a
source of ``implicit negative examples'', in such a way that they
would constrain the over-generalization.
</P>
<P>
Finally, It would be interesting to investigate the solution to point
f.  One possible way would be to disambiguate the senses of the
verbs appearing in the corpus, using the SRs already acquired and
gathering evidence of the patterns corresponding to each sense by
means of a technique similar to that used by
 <REF/>. Therefore, once disambiguated the verb senses it would be possible to split the set of SRs acquired.
</P>
<P>
Some of the future lines of research outlined above have been already
 investigated and their results included in <REF/>.
