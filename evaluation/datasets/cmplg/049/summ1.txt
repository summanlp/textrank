This paper presents a heuristic method that uses information in the
  Japanese text along with knowledge of English countability and
  number stored in transfer dictionaries to determine the countability
  and number of English noun phrases.  Incorporating this method into
  the machine translation system ALT-J/E, helped to raise the
  percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles
  and number from 65% to 73%.
