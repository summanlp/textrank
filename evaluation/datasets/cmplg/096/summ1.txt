If an agent does not possess the knowledge needed to perform an
action, it may privately plan to obtain the required information on
its own, or it may involve another agent in the planning process by
engaging it in a dialogue.  In this paper, we show how the
requirements of knowledge preconditions can be used to account for
information-seeking subdialogues in discourse.  We first present an
axiomatization of knowledge preconditions for the SharedPlan model of
 collaborative activity , and then provide an analysis of information-seeking subdialogues within a general
framework for discourse processing.  In this framework, SharedPlans
and relationships among them are used to model the intentional
component of Grosz and Sidner's  theory of
discourse structure.
