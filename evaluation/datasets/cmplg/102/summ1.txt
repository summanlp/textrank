We present an implemented compilation algorithm that translates
HPSG into lexicalized feature-based TAG, relating concepts of the two
theories. While HPSG has a more elaborated principle-based theory of
possible phrase structures, TAG provides the means to represent
lexicalized structures more explicitly.  Our objectives are met by
giving clear definitions that determine the projection of structures
from the lexicon, and identify ``maximal'' projections, auxiliary trees
and foot nodes.
