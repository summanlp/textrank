We study the computational complexity of the parsing problem
  of a variant of Lambek Categorial Grammar that we call     semidirectional. In semidirectional Lambek calculus SDL there
  is an additional non-directional abstraction rule allowing the formula
  abstracted over to appear anywhere in the premise sequent's
  left-hand side, thus
  permitting non-peripheral extraction.
  SDL grammars are able to generate each context-free language and
  more than that. We show that the parsing problem for semidirectional
  Lambek Grammar is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition
  problem.
