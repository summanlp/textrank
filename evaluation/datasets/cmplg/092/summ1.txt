In this paper we present a formalization of the centering
approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse and use it as
the basis for an algorithm to track discourse context and bind
 pronouns. As described in , the process of centering attention on entities in the discourse gives rise to the
intersentential transitional states of continuing, retaining
and  shifting.
We propose an extension to these states which handles some
additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns.  The algorithm has
been implemented in an HPSG natural language system which serves as
the interface to a database query application.
