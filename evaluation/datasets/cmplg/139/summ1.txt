Off-line compilation of logic grammars using Magic allows an
  incorporation of filtering into the logic underlying the grammar.
  The explicit definite clause characterization of filtering resulting
  from Magic compilation allows processor independent and logically
  clean optimizations of dynamic bottom-up processing with
  respect to goal-directedness.  Two filter optimizations based
  on the program transformation technique of Unfolding are
  discussed which are of practical and theoretical interest.
