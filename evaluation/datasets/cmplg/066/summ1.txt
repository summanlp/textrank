 Intelligent Voice Prosthesis is a communication tool which reconstructs the meaning of an ill-structured sequence of icons or symbols, and expresses this meaning
into sentences of a Natural Language (French). It has been developed for the
use of people who cannot express themselves orally in natural language, and
further, who are not able to comply to grammatical rules such as those of
natural language. We describe how available corpora of iconic communication by
children with Cerebral Palsy has led us to implement a simple and relevant
semantic description of the symbol lexicon. We then show how a
unification-based, bottom-up semantic analysis allows the system to uncover
the meaning of the user's utterances by computing proper dependencies between
the symbols. The result of the analysis is then passed to a lexicalization
module which chooses the right words of natural language to use, and builds a
linguistic semantic network. This semantic network is then generated into
French sentences via hierarchization into trees, using a lexicalized Tree
Adjoining Grammar. Finally we describe the modular, customizable interface
which has been developed for this system.
