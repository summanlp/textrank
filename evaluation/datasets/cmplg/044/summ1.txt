Semantic clusters of a domain form an important feature that can
be useful for performing syntactic and semantic disambiguation.  Several
attempts have been made to extract the semantic clusters of a domain by
probabilistic or taxonomic techniques.  However, not much progress has been
made in evaluating the obtained semantic clusters.  This paper
focuses on an evaluation mechanism that can be used to evaluate semantic
clusters produced by a system against those provided by human
experts.
