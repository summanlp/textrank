A variety of statistical methods for noun compound analysis
are implemented and compared.  The results 
support two main conclusions.  First, the use of conceptual 
association not only enables a broad coverage, but
also improves the accuracy.  Second, an analysis
model based on dependency grammar is substantially
more accurate than one based on deepest constituents,
even though the latter is more prevalent in the
literature.
