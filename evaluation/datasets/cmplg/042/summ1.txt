We describe and experimentally evaluate a method for automatically
clustering words according to their distribution in particular
syntactic contexts. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest
distortion sets of clusters. As the annealing parameter increases,
existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a
hierarchical ``soft'' clustering of the data. Clusters are used as the
basis for class models of word coocurrence, and the models evaluated
with respect to held-out test data.
