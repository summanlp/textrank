The lexicalist approach to Machine Translation offers significant
advantages in the development of linguistic descriptions.  However, the
Shake-and-Bake generation algorithm of [] is
NP-complete.  We present a polynomial time algorithm for lexicalist MT
generation provided that sufficient information can be transferred to
ensure more determinism.
