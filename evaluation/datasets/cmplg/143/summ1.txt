Conversation between two people is usually of  MIXED-INITIATIVE,
with  CONTROL over the conversation being transferred from one
person to another.  We apply a set of rules for the transfer of
control to 4 sets of dialogues consisting of a total of 1862 turns.
The application of the control rules lets us derive domain-independent
discourse structures. The derived structures indicate that initiative
plays a role in the structuring of discourse.  In order to explore the
relationship of control and initiative to discourse processes like
centering, we analyze the distribution of four different classes of
anaphora for two data sets. This distribution indicates that some
control segments are hierarchically related to others.  The analysis
suggests that discourse participants often mutually agree to a change
of topic. We also compared initiative in Task Oriented and Advice
Giving dialogues and found that both allocation of control and the
manner in which control is transferred is radically different for the
two dialogue types. These differences can be explained in terms of
collaborative planning principles.
