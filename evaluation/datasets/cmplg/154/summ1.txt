Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one
  of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a
  recurrent problem in pragmatics.  This paper provides a theoretical
  framework, called stratified logic, that can accommodate
  defeasible pragmatic inferences. The framework yields an algorithm
  that computes the conversational, conventional, scalar, clausal, and
  normal state implicatures; and the presuppositions that are
  associated with utterances. The algorithm applies equally to simple
  and complex utterances and sequences of utterances.
