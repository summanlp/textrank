Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to
  part-of-speech tagging.  In this paper we present a technique for fully
  unsupervised statistical acquisition of rules which guess possible
  parts-of-speech for unknown words.  Three complementary sets of
  word-guessing rules are induced from the lexicon and a raw corpus:
  prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and
  ending-guessing rules. The learning was performed on the Brown Corpus
  data and rule-sets, with a highly competitive performance, were
  produced and compared with the state-of-the-art.
