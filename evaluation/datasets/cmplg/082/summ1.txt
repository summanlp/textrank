The recognition problem for attribute-value grammars(AVGs) was shown
to be undecidable by Johnson in 1988. Therefore, the general
form of AVGs is of no practical use. In this paper we study
a very restricted form of AVG, for which the recognition problem
is decidable (though still 


 -complete), the R-AVG. We show that
the R-AVG formalism captures all of the context free languages and
more, and introduce a variation on the so-called off-line
parsability constraint, the honest
parsability constraint, which lets different types of
R-AVG coincide precisely with well-known time complexity classes.
