This paper addresses an important problem in Example-Based Machine Translation
(EBMT), namely how to measure similarity between a sentence fragment and a set
of stored examples. A new method is proposed that measures similarity according
to both surface structure and content. A second contribution is the use of
clustering to make retrieval of the best matching example from the database
more efficient. Results on a large number of test cases from the CELEX database
are presented.
