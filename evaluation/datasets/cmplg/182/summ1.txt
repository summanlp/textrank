Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech
into words without the benefit of a fully developed lexicon. Several
sources of information in speech might help infants solve this
problem, including prosody, semantic correlations and phonotactics.
Research to date has focused on determining to which of these sources
infants might be sensitive, but little work has been done to determine
the potential usefulness of each source. The computer simulations
reported here are a first attempt to measure the usefulness of
distributional and phonotactic information in segmenting phoneme
sequences. The algorithms hypothesize different segmentations of the
input into words and select the best hypothesis according to the
Minimum Description Length principle. Our results indicate that while
there is some useful information in both phoneme distributions and
phonotactic rules, the combination of both sources is most useful.
