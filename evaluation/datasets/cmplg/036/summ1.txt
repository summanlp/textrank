In this paper, I argue, contrary to the prevailing opinion in the
linguistics and philosophy literature, that a sortal approach to
aspectual composition can indeed be
explanatory.  In support of this view, I develop a synthesis of
competing proposals by Hinrichs, Krifka and Jackendoff which takes
Jackendoff's cross-cutting sortal distinctions as its point of
departure.  To show that the account is well-suited for computational
purposes, I also sketch an implemented calculus of eventualities which
yields many of the desired inferences.  Further details on both the
model-theoretic semantics and the implementation can be found in
 .
