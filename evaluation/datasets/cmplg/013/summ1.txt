A technique for reducing a tagset used for n-gram part-of-speech
disambiguation is introduced and evaluated in an experiment. The
technique ensures that all information that is provided by the original
tagset can be restored from the reduced one. This is crucial, since we
are interested in the linguistically motivated tags for part-of-speech
disambiguation. The reduced tagset needs fewer parameters for its
statistical model and allows more accurate parameter estimation.
Additionally, there is a slight but not significant improvement of
tagging accuracy.
