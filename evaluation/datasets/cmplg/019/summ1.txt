This paper proposes a new indicator of 
text structure, called the lexical cohesion profile
(LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a text.
A text segment is a coherent scene; the words in a
segment are linked together via lexical cohesion
relations.  LCP records mutual similarity of words
in a sequence of text.  The similarity of words,
which represents their cohesiveness, is computed
using a semantic network.  Comparison with the text
segments marked by a number of subjects shows that
LCP closely correlates with the human judgments.
LCP may provide valuable information for resolving
anaphora and ellipsis.
