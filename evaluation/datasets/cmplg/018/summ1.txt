 Evans and Gazdar , introduced DATR as a simple, non-monotonic language for representing natural language lexicons.
Although a number of implementations of DATR exist, the full language
has until now lacked an explicit, declarative semantics. This paper
rectifies the situation by providing a mathematical semantics for
DATR. We present a view of DATR as a language for defining certain
kinds of partial functions by cases. The formal model provides a
transparent treatment of DATR's notion of global context. It is shown
that DATR's default mechanism can be accounted for by interpreting
value descriptors as families of values indexed by paths.
