We describe how substantial domain-independent language-processing
systems for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually
adapting an existing English-language system, the SRI Core Language
Engine. We explain the adaptation process in detail, and argue that it
provides a fairly general recipe for converting a grammar-based system
for English into a corresponding one for a Romance language.
