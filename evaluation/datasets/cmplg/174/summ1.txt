We predict discourse segment boundaries from linguistic
features of utterances, using a corpus of spoken narratives as data.
We present two methods for developing segmentation algorithms from
training data: hand tuning and machine learning.  When multiple types
of features are used, results approach human
performance on an independent test set (both
methods), and using cross-validation (machine learning).
