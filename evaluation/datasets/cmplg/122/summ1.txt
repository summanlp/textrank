Common algorithms for sentence and word-alignment allow the automatic
identification
of word translations from parallel texts. This study suggests that the
identification
of word translations should also be possible with non-parallel and even
unrelated texts. The
method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between
the patterns
of word co-occurrences in texts of different languages.
