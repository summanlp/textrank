The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used
to locate
syntactic constituents of  natural language. This paper describes a fully
automated hybrid system, using neural nets operating within a grammatic
framework.
It addresses the representation of  language for
connectionist processing, and describes methods of constraining the problem
size. The function of the network is briefly explained, and results
are given.
