This paper shows the necessity of distinguishing different
  referential uses of noun phrases in machine translation.  We argue
  that differentiating between the generic, referential and ascriptive
  uses of noun phrases is the minimum necessary to generate articles
  and number correctly when translating from Japanese to English.
  Heuristics for determining these differences are proposed for a
  Japanese-to-English machine translation system.  Finally the results
  of using the proposed heuristics are shown to have raised the
  percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles
  and number in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system
  ALT-J/E from 65% to 77%.
