We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between
          control and discourse structure. We applied control criteria to
          four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure. We
          investigated the mechanism for changing control between these
          structures and found that utterance type and not cue words
          predicted shifts of control. Participants used certain types of
          signals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but
          resorted to interruptions when they were not.
