We propose a paradigm for concurrent natural language generation. In
order to represent grammar rules distributively, we adopt categorial
unification grammar (CUG) where each category owns its functional
type. We augment typed lambda calculus with several new combinators,
to make the order of 
lambda-conversions free for partial / local
processing. The concurrent calculus is modeled with Chemical Abstract Machine.  We show an example of a Japanese causative auxiliary verb that requires a drastic rearrangement of
case domination.
