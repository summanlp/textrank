The paper argues the importance of high-quality translation for
spoken language translation systems. It describes an
architecture suitable for rapid development of high-quality
limited-domain translation systems, which has been implemented within
an advanced prototype English to French spoken language translator.
The focus of the paper is the hybrid transfer model which combines
unification-based rules and a set of trainable statistical
preferences; roughly, rules encode domain-independent grammatical
information and preferences encode domain-dependent distributional
information.  The preferences are trained from sets of examples
produced by the system, which have been annotated by human judges as
correct or incorrect.  An experiment is described in which the model
was tested on a 2000 utterance sample of previously unseen data.
