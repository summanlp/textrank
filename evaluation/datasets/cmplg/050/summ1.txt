By strictest interpretation, theories of both centering and
  intonational meaning fail to predict the existence of pitch accented
  pronominals.  Yet they occur felicitously in spoken discourse.  To
  explain this, I emphasize the dual functions served by pitch
  accents, as markers of both propositional (semantic/pragmatic) and
  attentional salience.  This distinction underlies my proposals about
  the attentional consequences of pitch accents when applied to
  pronominals, in particular, that while most pitch accents may weaken
  or reinforce a cospecifier's status as the center of attention, a
  contrastively stressed pronominal may force a shift, even when
  contraindicated by textual features.
