Eric Brill introduced
transformation-based learning
and showed that it can do part-of-speech tagging
with fairly high accuracy.
The same method can be applied
at a higher level of textual interpretation
for locating chunks in the tagged text,
including non-recursive ``baseNP'' chunks.
For this purpose, it is convenient
to view chunking as a tagging problem
by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word.
In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data,
this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 92%
for baseNP chunks and 88%
for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence.
Some interesting adaptations
to the transformation-based learning approach
are also suggested by this application.
