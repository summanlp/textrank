We show that in modeling social interaction, particularly dialogue,
the attitude of obligation can be a useful adjunct to the
popularly considered attitudes of belief, goal, and intention and
their mutual and shared counterparts. In particular, we show how discourse obligations can be used to account in a natural manner for
the connection between a question and its answer in dialogue and how
obligations can be used along with other parts of the discourse
context to extend the coverage of a dialogue system.
