GLR* is a recently developed robust version of the Generalized LR Parser
[], that can parse almost any input sentence by ignoring
unrecognizable parts of the sentence. On a given input sentence, the parser
returns a collection of parses that correspond to maximal, or close to maximal,
parsable subsets of the original input. This paper describes recent work on
developing an integrated heuristic scheme for selecting the parse that is
deemed ``best'' from such a collection. We describe the heuristic measures
used and their combination scheme. Preliminary results from experiments
conducted on parsing speech recognized spontaneous speech are also reported.
