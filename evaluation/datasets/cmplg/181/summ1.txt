This paper presents a plan-based architecture for response generation
in collaborative consultation dialogues, with emphasis on cases in
which the system (consultant) and user (executing agent) disagree.
Our work contributes to an overall system for collaborative
problem-solving by providing a plan-based framework that captures the
Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of collaboration, and by allowing
the system to initiate subdialogues to negotiate proposed additions to
the shared plan and to provide support for its claims. In addition,
our system handles in a unified manner the negotiation of proposed
domain actions, proposed problem-solving actions, and beliefs proposed
by discourse actions. Furthermore, it captures cooperative responses
within the collaborative framework and accounts for why questions are
sometimes never answered.
