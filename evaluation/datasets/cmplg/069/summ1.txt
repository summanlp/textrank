The paper demonstrates that exponential complexities with respect to
grammar size and input length have little impact on the performance of three
unification-based parsing algorithms, using a wide-coverage grammar. The
results imply that the study and optimisation of unification-based parsing
must rely on empirical data until complexity theory can more accurately
 predict the practical behaviour of such parsers.
