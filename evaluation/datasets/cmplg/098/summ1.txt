This paper introduces a spelling correction system which integrates
seamlessly with morphological analysis using a multi-tape formalism.
Handling of various Semitic error problems is illustrated, with
reference to Arabic and Syriac examples.  The model handles errors
vocalisation, diacritics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic
idiosyncrasies, in addition to Damerau errors.  A complementary
correction strategy for morphologically sound but morphosyntactically
ill-formed words is outlined.
