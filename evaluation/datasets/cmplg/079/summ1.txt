We show how a general grammar may be automatically adapted for fast
parsing of utterances from a specific domain by means of constituent
pruning and grammar specialization based on explanation-based
learning. These methods together give an order of magnitude increase
in speed, and the coverage loss entailed by grammar specialization is
reduced to approximately half that reported in previous
work. Experiments described here suggest that the loss of coverage has
been reduced to the point where it no longer causes significant
performance degradation in the context of a real application.
