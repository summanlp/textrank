Aggregating different pieces of similar information is
necessary to generate concise and easy to understand reports in
technical domains.  This paper presents a general algorithm that
combines similar messages in order to generate one or more coherent
sentences for them.  The process is not as trivial as might be
expected.  Problems encountered are briefly described.
