DTG are designed to share some of the advantages of TAG
while overcoming some of its limitations.  DTG involve two
composition operations called subsertion and sister-adjunction. The most
distinctive feature of DTG is that, unlike TAG, there is complete
uniformity in the way that the two DTG operations relate lexical
items: subsertion always corresponds to complementation and
sister-adjunction to modification.  Furthermore, DTG, unlike TAG,
can provide a uniform analysis for wh-movement in English and
Kashmiri, despite the fact that the wh element in Kashmiri appears
in sentence-second position, and not sentence-initial position as in
English.
