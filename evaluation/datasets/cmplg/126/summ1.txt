Explanation-based generalization is used to extract a specialized grammar
from the original one using a training corpus of parse trees. This allows
very much faster parsing and gives a lower error rate, at the price of a
small loss in coverage. Previously, it has been necessary to specify the
tree-cutting criteria (or operationality criteria) manually; here they are
derived automatically from the training set and the desired coverage of the
specialized grammar.
This is done by assigning an entropy value to each node in the parse trees
and cutting in the nodes with sufficiently high entropy values.
