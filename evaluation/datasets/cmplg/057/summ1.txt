We describe an implemented system for robust domain-independent syntactic
parsing of English, using a unification-based grammar of part-of-speech and
punctuation labels coupled with a probabilistic LR parser. We present
evaluations of the system's performance along several different dimensions;
these enable us to assess the contribution that each individual part
is making to the success of the system as a whole, and thus prioritise the effort
to be devoted to its further enhancement. Currently, the system is able to parse
around 80% of sentences in a substantial corpus of general text containing a
number of distinct genres. On a random sample of 250 such sentences the
system has a mean crossing bracket rate of 0.71 and recall and precision of 83%
and 84% respectively when evaluated against manually-disambiguated
 analyses.
