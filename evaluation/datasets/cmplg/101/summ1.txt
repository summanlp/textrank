The formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars, a variant of
standard tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), was intended to allow the use
of TAGs for language transduction in addition to language
specification.  In previous work, the definition of the transduction
relation defined by a synchronous TAG was given by appeal to an
iterative rewriting process.  The rewriting definition of derivation
is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the
formalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not
impossible.
We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous
tree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard
tree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and
implementability problems of the original rewriting definition.  The
decrease in expressivity, which would otherwise make the method
unusable, is offset by the incorporation of an alternative definition
of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously proposed for
completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to entertain
using the natural definition of synchronous derivation.  Nonetheless,
some remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the
definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed.  It
remains for future research to tune the exact requirements on the
allowable mappings.
