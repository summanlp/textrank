A natural next step in the evolution of constraint-based grammar
formalisms from rewriting formalisms is to abstract fully away from the details
of the grammar mechanism--to express syntactic theories purely in terms of the
properties of the class of structures they license.  By focusing on the
structural properties of languages rather than on mechanisms for generating or
checking structures that exhibit those properties, this model-theoretic
approach can offer simpler and 
significantly clearer expression of theories and can potentially provide a
uniform formalization, allowing disparate theories to be compared on
the basis of those properties.  We discuss 

,
a monadic second-order
logical framework for such an approach to syntax that has the
distinctive virtue of being superficially expressive--supporting direct
statement of most linguistically significant syntactic properties--but having
well-defined strong generative capacity--languages are definable in 


iff
they are strongly context-free.  We draw examples from the realms of GPSG and
GB.
