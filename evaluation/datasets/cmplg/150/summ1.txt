Effective problem solving among multiple agents requires a better
understanding of the role of communication in collaboration.  In this
paper we show that there are communicative strategies that greatly
improve the performance of resource-bounded agents, but that these
strategies are highly
sensitive to the task requirements, situation parameters and agents'
resource limitations.  We base our argument on two sources of
evidence: (1) an analysis of a corpus of 55 problem solving dialogues,
and (2) experimental simulations of collaborative problem solving
dialogues in an experimental world, Design-World, where we
parameterize task requirements, agents' resources and communicative
strategies.
