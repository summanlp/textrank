This paper describes a method to automatically acquire the syntactic
and semantic classifications of unknown words. Our method reduces the
search space of the lexical acquisition  problem by
utilizing both the left and the right context of the unknown
word. Link Grammar provides a convenient framework in which to
implement our method.
