In this paper, we show that Higher-Order Coloured Unification -
a form of unification developed for automated theorem proving -
provides a general theory for modeling the interface between the
interpretation process and other sources of linguistic, non semantic
information. In particular, it provides the
general theory for the Primary Occurrence Restriction which
 's analysis called for.
