We propose an algorithm to resolve anaphors, tackling mainly the problem
of intrasentential antecedents. We base our methodology on the fact that such 
antecedents are likely to occur in embedded sentences. Sidner's focusing mechanism 
is used as the basic algorithm in a more complete approach. The proposed algorithm
has been tested and implemented as a part of a conceptual analyser, mainly to
process pronouns. Details of an evaluation are given.
