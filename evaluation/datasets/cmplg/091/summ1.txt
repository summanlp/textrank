In collaborative planning activities, since the agents are autonomous
and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that conflicts arise in their
beliefs during the planning process. In cases where such conflicts are
relevant to the task at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the
discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational
strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for
engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that
warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most
effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in
cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate
evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by
capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully
handle embedded negotiation subdialogues.
