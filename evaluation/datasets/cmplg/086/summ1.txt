We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest
  in semantic accounts of coordination is instead appropriately
  handled in terms of structure-sharing in LFG
  f-structures.  We provide an extension to the previous
   account of LFG semantics  according to which   dependencies between f-structures are viewed as
  resources; as a result a one-to-one correspondence between uses
  of f-structures and meanings is maintained.  The
  resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where
  other approaches overgenerate; the very property of
  resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be
  problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over
  systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation.
