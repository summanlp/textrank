This paper describes  RESOLVE, a system that uses decision
trees to learn how to classify coreferent phrases in the domain of
business joint ventures.  An experiment is presented in which the
performance of  RESOLVE is compared to the performance of
a manually engineered set of rules for the same task.  The results
show that decision trees achieve higher performance than the rules in
two of three evaluation metrics developed for the coreference task.
In addition to achieving better performance than the rules,
 RESOLVE provides a framework that facilitates the
exploration of the types of knowledge that are useful for solving the
coreference problem.
