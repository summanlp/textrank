A simple and general method is described that can combine different
knowledge sources to reorder N-best lists of hypotheses produced by a
speech recognizer. The method is automatically trainable, acquiring
information from both positive and negative examples.  Experiments are
described in which it was tested on a 1000-utterance sample of unseen
ATIS data.
