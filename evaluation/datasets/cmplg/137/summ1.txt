We give a new treatment of tabular LR parsing,
which is an alternative to Tomita's generalized LR algorithm.
The advantage is twofold. Firstly, our treatment is conceptually more
attractive because it uses simpler concepts, such as grammar
transformations and standard tabulation techniques also
know as chart parsing. Secondly, the static and dynamic
complexity of parsing, both in space and time, is significantly reduced.
