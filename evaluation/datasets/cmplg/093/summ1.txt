This paper shows how DATR, a widely used formal language for lexical
knowledge representation, can be used to define an LTAG lexicon as
an inheritance hierarchy with internal lexical rules.  A bottom-up
featural encoding is used for LTAG trees and this allows lexical
rules to be implemented as covariation constraints within feature
structures.  Such an approach eliminates the considerable redundancy
otherwise associated with an LTAG lexicon.
