A simple method for categorizing texts into pre-determined text genre
categories using the statistical standard technique of discriminant
analysis is demonstrated with application to the Brown corpus. Discriminant
analysis makes it possible use a large number of parameters that
may be specific for a certain corpus or information stream, and combine
them into a small number of functions, with the parameters weighted
on basis of how useful they are for discriminating text genres. An
application to information retrieval is discussed.
