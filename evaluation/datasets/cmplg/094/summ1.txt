It is claimed that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis, event
reference, and interclausal coherence can be explained by two features
of the linguistic form in question: (1) whether the form  leaves
behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the
form is anaphoric in the semantics.  It is proposed that these
features interact with one of two types of discourse inference, namely
Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation inference.
The differing ways in which these types of inference utilize syntactic
and semantic representations predicts phenomena for which it
is otherwise difficult to account.
