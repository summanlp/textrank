We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame
  patterns (selectional patterns) from large corpus data. In
  particular, we propose a method of learning dependencies between
  case frame slots. We view the problem of learning case frame
  patterns as that of learning a multi-dimensional discrete joint
  distribution, where random variables represent case slots. We then
  formalize the dependencies between case slots as the     probabilistic dependencies between these random variables. Since
  the number of parameters in a multi-dimensional joint distribution
  is exponential in general, it is infeasible to accurately estimate
  them in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we settle with
  approximating the target joint distribution by the product of     low order component distributions, based on corpus data. In
  particular we propose to employ an efficient learning algorithm
  based on the MDL principle to realize this task. Our experimental
  results indicate that for certain classes of verbs, the accuracy
  achieved in a disambiguation experiment is improved by using the
  acquired knowledge of dependencies.
